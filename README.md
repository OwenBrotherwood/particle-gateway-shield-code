Particle Gateway Code
==========
Bluz is a Development Kit (DK) that implements the Wiring language and talks to the [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) cloud through Bluetooth Low Energy. It can be accessed through a REST API and programmed from a Web IDE.

The code in this repository is used for a Particle Core/Photon/Electron to act as a gateway device using the bluz gateway shield. For more information on setting up the gateway shield, please see the [documentation.](http://docs.bluz.io/tutorials/gateway_getting_started/)

The code is available as a library in the Particle Web IDE under the titel Bluz Gateway.

##Programming Particle Device

For full instructions to program a Particle board, please refer to the [bluz docs on programming the device.](http://docs.bluz.io/tutorials/gateway_getting_started/)
